# Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was inspired by a tutorial from Kevin Powell, which guided me through the process of creating a functional and stylish calculator interface.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clean and responsive design
- Keyboard support for desktop users

## How to Use
To use the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click on the buttons with your mouse or use your keyboard's numeric keys to perform calculations.

## Installation
No installation is necessary. You can clone or download this repository and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Credits
I would like to thank Kevin Powell for his excellent tutorial on building a calculator using web technologies.
